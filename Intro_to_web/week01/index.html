	<h1>Response to "Ways of Seeing"</h1>
	<br>In this video, John Berger told me a new idea of seeing things, seeing with context. He thinks that seeing a painting physically or seeing a painting on laptop are different, because these two situations relate to two different contexts. Not only seeing is related to context, seeing is also related to personal experiences. For example, in one of the paintings, children related the figure with their own genders or related that with Bible stories which they have learnt before. 
	<br>
	<br>This video also teaches me a lot about being critical. After his concepts of seeing, I also watch his video skeptically. I believe that everyone may have their own unique understanding of this video, but this video teaches me to be critical about media information. Not only a painting, a piece of news, a piece of record clip or a picture can mislead people by editing or arranging. I will do my best to be critical.
