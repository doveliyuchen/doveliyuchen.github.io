<div class="ques">My parents are all working in a hospital. And my mom's job is taking everyone's skin temperature at the hospital gate. She has to wear the protection suit, and that suit is not comfortable at all. She cannot go to bathroom, cuz the suit is sigle-used. But she is happy that she can contribute in our society.<br><br>

	I have been to Wuhan last year Christmas eve, it is a great city. Eveyone was celebrating the Christmas, and every place give you an apple for free, cuz apple soud like being safe in Chinese. No one can image that after 5 days, the virus will destroy all their happiness.<br>

	THE UNKNOWN CAUSED PNEUMONIA.
	<br>
	<br>
	On December 30th, the unkown caused pneumonia in Wuhan become a breaking news. No one konws about this disease.<br><br>
	On December 31st, the Huanan wet market where the virus originated (just an assumption, cuz there are early cases that have no relation with that wet market.) was forced to shut down.
	On January 2nd, other cities also shut the wet market down. 
	Around January 5th, it is confirmed that this virus can infect between people.
	On January 23rd, Wuhan was lockdown.
	On January 24th, every other province provide medical help teams to Hubei province. Each province helps a city in Hubei province, and meanwhile it was the Chinese Lunar New Year Eve, usually everyone should stay with their family. 
	On January 25th, Chinese Lunar New Year, everyone should celebrate it with their family, and all relatives and friends should visit each other for the new year wish.
	<br>
	<br>
	But, this year, no one goes out. Everyone is voluntarily self-quarantined. 
	<br>
	<br>
	On January 30th, I have to go back school, and take the plane. At the entrance of our local airport, everyone is required to take out their ID cards and record their temperature. 
	<br>
	On early Feburary, America closed the border for Chinese, but I got lucky that I got in New York City on January 31st.<br><br>
